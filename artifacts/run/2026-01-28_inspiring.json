      "abstract": "We propose a novel use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as unsupervised anomaly detectors in particle physics. Using lightweight LLM-like networks with encoder-based architectures trained to reconstruct background events via masked-token prediction, our method identifies anomalies through deviations in reconstruction performance, without prior knowledge of signal characteristics. Applied to searches for simultaneous four-top-quark production, this token-based approach shows competitive performance against established unsupervised methods and effectively captures subtle discrepancies in collider data, suggesting a promising direction for model-independent searches for new physics.",

      "abstract": "Non-metricity provides a natural extension of Riemannian geometry, yet its experimental signatures remain largely unexplored. In this work we investigate how spacetime non-metricity can be probed through high-precision observations, focusing on atomic clocks and gravitational waves as complementary tools. Working within Weyl geometry as a minimal realization of vectorial non-metricity, we formulate observable effects in a gauge-invariant manner and show that they are associated with path-dependent length transport governed by the Weyl field strength. We derive constraints from atomic-clock experiments and demonstrate that, although gravitational waves do not directly source the Weyl field at linear order, its dynamical contribution induces a backreaction on gravitational-wave propagation, leading to an anomalous strain. As a result, the absence of deviations from General Relativity in current gravitational-wave observations already places meaningful and strong constraints on dynamical non-metric degrees of freedom.",

      "abstract": "We study a $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model (SM) in which Dirac neutrino masses are generated radiatively at the one-loop level through the exchange of new beyond the SM fields. This framework establishes a direct connection between neutrino mass generation and the dark sector, with the stability of the dark matter ensured by a residual discrete $Z_6$ symmetry arising from the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_{B-L}$. We investigate the resulting charged lepton flavor violating processes and dark matter phenomenology, saturating relic observations and direct-detection constraints, and analyze the collider signatures of the dark sector at the Large Hadron Collider and at a future muon collider. We have identified excellent prospects for observing the considered dark matter candidates in these colliders, even with lower integrated luminosities than the proposed one.",
